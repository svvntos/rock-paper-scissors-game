# rock-paper-scissors-game
Simple Rock, Paper, Scissors game I made using Vanilla JS.
This is a single-player game, in which once you have made your choice, you could see whether you win, lose or the match ends in a draw based on what the computer(depicting the opponent) has chosen. The score-board keeps account of how many games you have won and lost.

Game Rules:- It's a pretty simple hand game usually played between two players. Rock beats scissors, scissors beats paper and paper beats rock. If both players choose the same thing, it results in a draw.
